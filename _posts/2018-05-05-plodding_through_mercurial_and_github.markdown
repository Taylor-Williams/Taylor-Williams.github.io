when i was working on a website for my website with my mom in the summer of 2016 i couldn't really wrap my head around what Mercurial WAS. i know that i was committing these changes to a  program and i'd sign my name and write a short description of what I'd done but since it was just a project with my mother and I, i didn't really see the whole scope of version control. Every morning i'd come in and murcurial pull update but it always worked; what was the point of the damn thing if it's always going to work?

during that summer i had friends who were always mentioning Github. i'd hear all sorts of things. "my boss wants me to check out a new fork in the github there's something wrong" or "i haven't had enough commits and my manager is worried about my productivity" or "check it out, it's all GREEN! this month". I knew the essense of what they were saying but i wanted to convince my mom to switch over to Github because it seemed so much more popular. she said it would be a good idea but we had other things to focus on right now, it was a bit too much of a PITA to take care of when we had all these versions floating around between live, test, test-update... switching would have to hold off. and it did. the whole summer.

Coming to familiarize yourself with Github and the whole idea of version control and everyone working on their own versions of a larger project where they can contribute their work and pull in the most recent versions of everyone else's makes you wonder... how did any of this ever work before? projects must have been a whole MESS of people updating a project only to realize that  the version had changed and the files they required weren't what they needed anymore so they try to add some bit to their files to make up for it but there's no way to communicate to everyone else that.... well, it's ugly to think about. Sometimes you wish you could've gotten into a profession back in the "good old days", sometimes you're thankful for the advancements you benefit from.
