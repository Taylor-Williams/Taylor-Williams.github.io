I grew up in Seattle with a Microsoft parent. In our neighborhood it was pretty common, probably one in every three families around me had the mom or dad either working for Microsoft or another tech company. Going through high school I focused on math and science but really enjoyed chemistry and fantasized about the medical career path. My brother was trying and failing to get into the Computer Science major at the University of Washington and I thought that it didn't interest me at all.

My brothers graduation lined up within a year of my high school graduation and even though he finished in math he was able to find a job with a consultant company that allowed him to program. he loved it. he convinced me to take the intro CS series at UW my freshman year even though i was *certain* of my medicine path. Turns out I loved the two-course series. a lot. I kind of tried to convince myself that it wasn't my favorite topic because it made me feel guilty. But i took the next course after that series, too, because data systems sounded more interesting to me than everyone else i knew. *shrug*. And the weirdest thing is that it was.

I didn't end up following on the path of Computer Science courses mostly because i finished those classes with an average of 3.56 GPA which was good, most of my friends were envious, but the average GPA to get into the CS program at the school was 3.8 and i didn't want to retake the courses and change everything about my course plan to accomodate something that was not guaranteed.

I'm coming back now because I love the thought process, the methodical reasoning of programming, the high that you get when you correctly find the solution to a problem. The rush of being clever enough to problem solve your way through some issue is usually followed by realizing that it's just a standard play in the playbook of any experienced programmer. But that's okay, everyone wen't through your process and your struggle and letting that deter you would be a mistake, everyone sucks before they are good.
